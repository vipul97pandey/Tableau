Project 1 – Laptop Retail Strategy - The project objective is to define a product strategy and 
pricing policy for a leading laptop retail chain in London to maximize projected revenues in 
2016. The data available includes point of sale transactions, laptop configurations and 
product information, and store locations. The project involves analysing the top 20 laptop 
configurations sold in 2015, variations in average price over time, consistency in average 
prices across stores, variation in laptop sales by month or day of the month, correlation 
between lower average pricing and higher sales, grouping 864 configurations into 32 groups 
based on high-low groups for each configuration parameter and comparing the average 
price for these groups, analysing the distance customers travel to buy laptops and its impact 
on sales, and creating a store-view dashboard to include worksheets related to store 
numbers using interactive filters.


Project 2 – Pharmaceutical Sales Analysis - In this pharmaceutical case study, we have 
data on Rx sales, drug distribution, returns, and sales managers by region. The objective is 
to analyse historical performance and market share of TabPharma, classify data based on 
sales and distribution costs, and understand sales and profits by segment, dosage form, 
drug routes, and regions. We will also analyse TabPharma's sales performance over time 
and its geo-distribution in the total market. Overall, the insights from this analysis will help 
with product screening and Rx budget planning.
